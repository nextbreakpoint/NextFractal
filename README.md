NextFractal contains code ported to Java from C/C++ code of open source projects Xaos and ContextFree.


## DESCRIPTION

NextFractal is an application for creating fractals and other algorithmically generated images. Images are generated from a script and some parameters. NextFractal provides tools for rendering fractals, creating time-based and event-based animations, organising images, and exporting images and animations.

NextFractal is currently able to interpret two scripting languages: Mandelbrot and CFDG. Mandelbrot is a domain specific language for creating images of the Mandelbrotâ€™s set (and its variants, such as Julia and Fatou sets). CFDG is a context-free grammar for creating images by an iterative process.


## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

NextFractal has been tested on OS X 10.14, Windows 7, and Linux/Debian 9 and Linux/Fedora 30.

Windows users must install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).

Linux users may have problems if their system doesn't have all the required libraries. Run the embedded java command (jdk/bin/java) to find out which libraries are missing.
